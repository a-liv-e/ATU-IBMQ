    "The uncertaintly principle is a statement which is relevant if we want to measure two different physical quantities for a given quantum system. So let's consider two Hermitian operators $A$ and $B$ which represent the two physical quantities. \n",

    "You will find a deriviation of the uncertainty principle in most textbooks on quantum physics, see for example section 3.5.1 Griffiths and Schroeter (3ed). The principle is typically stated as \n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Now there is a lot going on in this formula, and a lot of it is hidden in the quite compact notation we use! Most importantly note that the uncertainty principle is a statement about expectation values in a given state: Both $\\sigma_A^2$, $\\sigma_B^2$ and $\\left\\langle\\big[A,B\\big]\\right\\rangle$ are expectation values in a given state $|\\psi\\rangle$. To see this let's write things out more explicitly. We have on the left hand side the variance\n",
